# MOFA Scripts  

These scripts were originally sourced from package files like `Microsoft_Office_Reset_2.0.0.pkg` from *Office-Reset.com*, created by Paul Bowden. Since *Office-Reset.com* is no longer maintained, the MOFA and Mac Admin communities have taken over their maintenance, ensuring continued updates and improvements.  

We encourage users to contribute, enhance, fork, and suggest fixes to help refine these scripts for the community. In the future, we also plan to provide packaged versions of these scripts for easier deployment and use.

**Notes:** Currently, `cocopuff2u`, the maintainer of MOFA, does not have a developer account to sign packages, and their experience with building and signing packages has not yet been tested. While confident in their ability to handle it, they would appreciate guidance from someone experienced in the process. They prefer to maintain control over package signing to ensure the integrity and security of the packages, preventing any malicious alterations.
