# Office-Reset.com Archived Scripts  

These community-built scripts are archived copies sourced from package files like `Microsoft_Office_Reset_2.0.0.pkg` from *Office-Reset.com*, originally created by Paul Bowden. They were provided as a service to Mac admins needing reset functionality for specific Microsoft applications or services.  

**Note:** These scripts remain unchanged from their original versions within the package files. However, they are no longer actively maintained. Users are encouraged to switch to and contribute to the MOFA-maintained versions for the latest updates and ongoing support.
