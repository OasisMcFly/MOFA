# Office-Reset.com Archived Packages  

These community-built packages are archived copies sourced from *Office-Reset.com*, originally created by Paul Bowden. They were provided as a service to Mac admins needing reset functionality for specific Microsoft applications or services.  

**Note:** These packages remain unchanged from their original versions. However, they are no longer actively maintained. Users are encouraged to switch to and contribute to the MOFA-maintained versions for the latest updates and ongoing support.
